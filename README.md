# aos

Status: Preview
Version: 1.10.5.  
Module: `9afQ1PLf2mrshqCTZEzzJTR2gWaC9zNPnYgYEqg1Pt4`

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 20+

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io && aos
```

> NOTE: after the first time you run `aos` it installs it to your local machine, so the next time you want to run `aos`, just type `aos` + [enter]

## User Documentation

Go to [ao Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io)

## Project Background and Current Status

This project is a proof of concept implementation of the `aos` module and `aos console`, the module is located in the `process` directory of this repository. The `console` is located in the `src` directory of this repository.

## Design Principals

- aos the module is designed to be an operating system on the ao network, it provides developers the ability to build ao processes that are fast to iterate with and highly flexible. The design goal of the aos process is to not have too many opinions and implement the core functionality extremely well. The design should quickly reach a complete status. Currently it is in the `Preview` stage and should be progressing to an `Early` stage, then finally a `Complete` stage.

- aos console is an interactive shell to the aos module, the purpose of this shell is to provide developers with a fun and engaging experience with the aos operating system module, as well as users. Users should enjoy to run their personal processes and engage on the network, from trading, to chats, to games. So the console should be easy to install on all major os platforms.

## Preview Implementation

The current implementation of aos is using the ao wasm module and building with the ao cli that uses a emscripten `c` compiler and embeds `Lua v5.3` in the wasm binary. This gives the developers and users with a built in operating system with a first class interactive language to engage with the Process business logic. The `aos` module also provides features like `json`, `base64`,

## For Developers

The aos console is a command-line application that provides a easy to use DX experience to create Processes (aka Smart Contracts) on the ao Computer.

### Command-line options

You can provide a name for a specific Process, if the Process does not exist aos will spawn the process, then every time you run `aos [name]` it will locate that process and interact with it.

```sh
aos [name]
```

#### Flags

| Name                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Required |

| `--cron [Interval]`                           | The cron flag can only be used when spawning a process, it instructs the Process to generate messages every `Interval`. An Interval can be defined with a [n]-(period) for example: 1-minute, 10-minutes, 5-hours, 10-blocks, etc. | 0-1      |
| `--get-blueprints [dir]`                      | This command will grab blueprints from the `/blueprints` folder or a folder specified by the user. These blueprints are small lua files that can be applied to your process to automatically give it some functionality.           | 0-1      |
| `--tag-name [name]` and `--tag-value [value]` | These flags are also only when aos is spawning a Process. You may add many of these combinations as you would like and they will appear on the Process tags object                                                                 | 0-n      |
| `--load [luaFile]`                            | The load command allows you to load lua source files from your local directory.                                                                                                                                                    | 0-n      |

### Commands

When running the console, you can type `dot` commands to instruct the console to perform special instructions.

| Command                  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.editor`                | This command opens a simple cli editor that you can type on multiple lines, and then you can type `.done` or `.cancel` to exist editor mode. |
| `.load`                  | This command allows you to load a lua source file from your local directory                                                                  |
| `.load-blueprint [name]` | This command will grab a lua file from the blueprints directory and load it into your process.                                               |
| `.exit`                  | This command will exit you console, but you can also do `Ctrl-C` or `Ctrl-D`                                                                 |
