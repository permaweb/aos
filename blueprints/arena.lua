-- ARENA GAME BLUEPRINT.

-- REQUIREMENTS: cron must be added and activated for game operation.

-- This blueprint provides the framework to operate an 'arena' style game
-- inside an ao process. Games are played in rounds, where players aim to
-- eliminate one another until only one remains, or until the game time
-- has elapsed. The game process will play rounds indefinitely as players join
-- and leave.

-- When a player eliminates another, they receive the eliminated player's deposit token
-- as a reward. Additionally, the builder can provide a bonus of these tokens
-- to be distributed per round as an additional incentive. If the intended
-- player type in the game is a bot, providing an additional 'bonus'
-- creates an opportunity for coders to 'mine' the process's
-- tokens by competing to produce the best agent.

-- The builder can also provide other handlers that allow players to perform
-- actions in the game, calling 'eliminatePlayer()' at the appropriate moment
-- in their game logic to control the framework.

-- Processes can also register in a 'Listen' mode, where they will receive
-- all announcements from the game, but are not considered for entry into the
-- rounds themselves. They are also not unregistered unless they explicitly ask
-- to be.

-- GLOBAL VARIABLES.

-- Game progression modes in a loop:
-- [Not-Started] -> Waiting -> Playing -> [Someone wins or timeout] -> Waiting...
-- The loop is broken if there are not enough players to start a game after the waiting state.
